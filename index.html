                <p>Hi Ollie, this is Phillip writing to you – your boyfriend, your biggest fan, and the guy who’s lucky enough to call you his. I’m writing this letter because I want to appreciate you in the best way I can. Even though we haven’t met face to face yet, you’ve become one of the most important people in my life. This little book is just a piece of my heart, written out for you – the girl I love. I want you to know how much you mean to me and how our story, even though it’s just beginning, is already so special.</p>

                <p>Isn’t it funny how you’re just one month older than me? You, born on the 28th of August, and me on the 30th of September, both in 2005 – it’s like we were placed into the world close enough to find each other. I sometimes think maybe the universe had a small plan, to keep us only a month apart so we’d grow up together, even from a distance.</p>

                <p>We met in a simple but magical way – Facebook. You texted me first back in December, and that small message changed everything. I didn’t expect that random conversation to become something so deep, but the more we talked, the more I liked you. You were sweet, kind, funny, and real. From that very first moment, there was something different about you.</p>

                <p>Not everything was perfect at first. During our talking stage, things didn’t go as smoothly as we both hoped. We drifted apart, and I thought maybe that was the end. But deep down, something told me not to give up on you. It was a painful silence, but it taught me that I never wanted to lose you again.</p>

                <p>In February, I decided to swallow my pride and come back to you. I humbled myself because I knew what I wanted – and that was you. I reached out with hope in my heart, and you welcomed me back with that same warmth that made me fall for you in the first place. That moment changed everything. It was like starting over but better and stronger.</p>

                <p>Then came the big step – I asked you to officially be my girlfriend. And you said yes. I remember how happy I felt in that moment. It wasn’t just a relationship status; it was the beginning of something beautiful. Since then, we’ve been growing together for four amazing months, and every day with you feels like a blessing.</p>

You’re not just my girlfriend – you’re my best friend, my peace, and my daily motivation. Our connection is built on more than just words; it’s built on honesty, trust, and love.</p>

                <p>Ollie, I love you so much. You’ve taught me patience, love, and care in ways I didn’t expect. Even on tough days, just hearing your voice or reading your messages makes me feel better. You’re the reason I smile when I look at my phone, and the person I dream of holding close one day soon. I never thought I could love someone so deeply without even meeting them face-to-face, but here we are.</p>

                <p>Together, we are PHILLIVIA – two hearts, one name, one bond. It’s more than just a couple nickname; it’s a symbol of everything we are and everything we’re becoming. Our love isn’t rushed. It’s growing with care, with time, and with understanding. This story is only at the beginning, Ollie, and I can’t wait to write the rest with you. You are my love, my girl, my Ollie. Forever and always.</p>
